If you have problems cloning the repository with the data, use a different command for cloning:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset-small.git
```

In this session, we'll be working with multiclass image classification with deep learning. The deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras will be implemented on clothing dataset to classify images of t-shirts.

The dataset has 5000 images of 20 different classes, however, we'll be using the subset which contains 10 of the most popular classes. The dataset can be downloaded from the above link.

- TensorFlow is a library to train deep learning models and Keras is higher level abstraction on the top of TensorFlow. Keras used to be separate library but from tensorflow 2+ version, keras became part of the tensorflow library. The libraries can be installed using `pip install tensorflow` (for CPU and GPU). However, additional setup is required to integrate TensorFlow with GPU. 
- Neural networks expect an image of a certain size, therefore, we need to provide the image size in `target_size` parameter of the `load_img` function.
- Each image consists of pixel and each of these pixels has the shape of 3 dimensions ***(height, width, color channels)***
- A typical color image consists of three color channels: `red`, `green` and `blue`. Each color channel has 8 bits or 1 byte and can represent distinct values between 0-256 (uint8 type).

**Classes, functions, and methods**:

- `import tensorflow as tf`: to import tensorflow library
- `from tensorflow import keras`: to import keras
- `from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img`: to import load_img function
- `load_img('path/to/image', targe_size=(150,150))`: to load the image of 150 x 150 size in PIL format
- `np.array(img)`: convert image into a numpy array of 3D shape, where each row of the array represents the value of red, green, and blue color channels of one pixel in the image.


## Notes

Add notes from the video (PRs are welcome)

* tensorflow and keras as deep learning libraries
* end-to-end open source machine learning framework
* tensorflow as library for training deep learning models
* keras as high-level abstraction on top of tensorflow
* installing tensorflow
* local vs cloud configuration
* loading and preprocessing images
* keras is part of tensorflow since version 2.0
* working with different image sizes
* processing images using the python pillow library
* encoding images as numpy arrays
* image size (i.e. 150 x 150 pixels) multiplied by number of colors (i.e. RGB) equals shape of array
* numpy array dtype as unsigned int8 (uint8) which includes the range from 0 to 255

- The keras applications has different pre-trained models with different architectures. We'll use the model [Xception](https://keras.io/api/applications/xception/) which takes the input image size of `(229, 229)` and each image pixels is scaled between `-1` and `1`
- We create the instance of the pre-trained model using `model = Xception(weights='imagenet', input_shape=(299, 229, 3))`. Our model will use the weights from pre-trained imagenet and expecting the input shape (229, 229, 3) of the image
- Along with image size, the model also expects the `batch_size` which is the size of the batches of data (default 32). If one image is passed to the model, then the expected shape of the model should be (1, 229, 229, 3)
- The image data was proprcessed using `preprocess_input` function, therefore, we'll have to use this function on our data to make predictions, like so: `X = preprocess_input(X)`
- The `pred = model.predict(X)` function returns 2D array of shape `(1, 1000)`, where 1000 is the probablity of the image classes. `decode_predictions(pred)` can be used to get the class names and their probabilities in readable format.
- In order to make the pre-trained model useful specific to our case, we'll have to do some tweak, which we'll do in the coming sections.
