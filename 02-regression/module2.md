## 2.1 Car price prediction project

This project is about the creation of a model for helping users to predict car prices. The dataset was obtained from [this 
kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset).

**Project plan:**

* Prepare data and Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Use linear regression for predicting price
* Understanding the internals of linear regression 
* Evaluating the model with RMSE
* Feature engineering  
* Regularization 
* Using the model 

The code and dataset are available at this [link](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/chapter-02-car-price).
