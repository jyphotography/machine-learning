## 4.1 Evaluation metrics: session overview

The fourth week of Machine Learning Zoomcamp is about different metrics to evaluate a binary classifier. These measures include accuracy, confusion table, precision, recall, ROC curves(TPR, FRP, random model, and ideal model), AUROC, and cross-validation. 

For this project, we used a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) about churn prediction.
